    <p>I make software for a living, but that doesn't keep me from coding for fun. I pretty much live to program.
    <br><br>
    Here, I document some of my many personal projects. In addition to the web page itself (I created it from scratch and implemented first using the LAMP, and now the MEAN, stack), I've been working on HTML5 games, blog design, and a host of smaller interests. This page in particular lets me use AngularJS, which is much quicker than jQuery.
    <br><br>
    Honestly, pretty much everything about computer science interests me, from game programming and new languages down to the more arcane theoretical areas (my to-do list includes learning Common Lisp and creating a language that interprets into Turing Machine instructions).
