# aphorism44New

This is my new webpage, using the MEAN stack, with an entirely RESTful design using an AngularJS state machine.

While my domain is still (as of September 2016) through GoDaddy, I have to host this page on Heroku and pipe it since GoDaddy doesn't support NodeJS. Likewise, my MongoDB is hosted on MLab, since GoDaddy doesn't support that either. I moved my original blog into WordPress, but only link to it here, since WordPress is made for the LAMP stack.

When my GoDaddy account expires in December, I need to find a MEAN-friendly host and possibly a new domain name.
