# aphorism44New

This is my personal website, which I'm always working on. It uses a MEAN stack (MondoDB/Express/AngularJS/Node). On the frontend, I use Angular custom directives to organize all the sections, and have some very basic mobile-responsive features (keeping the text readable on smaller devices). On the backend, I use Mongoose to help with MondoDB, and the Passport library to simplify the page's user login.

The page is active here: http://www.aphorism44.com.

I hold my IP address through NameCheap, and use Heroku to deploy this stack. The data is stored in the cloud at mLab (creator of MongoDB). My WordPress blog is linked to a different site (WordPress was primarily designed to work with PHP/MySQL).

My previous web page was built using the LAMP stack (Linux/Apache/MySQL/PHP), and used jQuery. I had written my own blog engine using TinyMCE, but decided to move to WordPress for easier integration into social media. The old code can be found in the "aphorism44" repository on GitHub.
